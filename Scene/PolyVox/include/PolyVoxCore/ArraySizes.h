	///The ArraySizes class provide a convienient way to specify the dimensions of an Array.
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	/// The Array class requires an array of integers to be passed to the constructor 
	/// to specify the dimensions of the Array to be built. C++ does not allow this to
	/// be done in place, and so it typically requires an extra line of code - something
	/// like this:
	///
	/// \code
	/// uint32_t dimensions[3] = {10, 20, 30}; // Array dimensions
	/// Array<3,float> array(dimensions);
	/// \endcode
	///
	/// The ArraySizes class can be constructed in place, and also provides implicit 
	/// conversion to an array of integers. Hence it is now possible to declare the
	/// above Array as follows:
	///
	/// \code
	/// Array<3,float> array(ArraySizes(10)(20)(30));
	/// \endcode
	///
	/// Usage of this class is therefore very simple, although the template code 
	/// behind it may appear complex. For reference, it is based upon the article here:
	/// http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/184401319/
