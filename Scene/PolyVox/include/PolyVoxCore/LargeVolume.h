	/// The LargeVolume class provides a memory efficient method of storing voxel data while also allowing fast access and modification.
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	/// A LargeVolume is essentially a 3D array in which each element (or <i>voxel</i>) is identified by a three dimensional (x,y,z) coordinate.
	/// We use the LargeVolume class to store our data in an efficient way, and it is the input to many of the algorithms (such as the surface
	/// extractors) which form the heart of PolyVox. The LargeVolume class is templatised so that different types of data can be stored within each voxel.
	///
	/// Basic usage
	/// -----------
	///
	/// The following code snippet shows how to construct a volume and demonstrates basic usage:
	///
	/// \code
	/// LargeVolume<Material8> volume(Region(Vector3DInt32(0,0,0), Vector3DInt32(63,127,255)));
	/// volume.setVoxelAt(15, 90, 42, Material8(5));
	/// std::cout << "Voxel at (15, 90, 42) has value: " << volume.getVoxelAt(15, 90, 42).getMaterial() << std::endl;
	/// std::cout << "Width = " << volume.getWidth() << ", Height = " << volume.getHeight() << ", Depth = " << volume.getDepth() << std::endl;
	/// \endcode
	///
	/// In this particular example each voxel in the LargeVolume is of type 'Material8', as specified by the template parameter. This is one of several
	/// predefined voxel types, and it is also possible to define your own. The Material8 type simply holds an integer value where zero represents
	/// empty space and any other value represents a solid material.
	/// 
	/// The LargeVolume constructor takes a Region as a parameter. This specifies the valid range of voxels which can be held in the volume, so in this
	/// particular case the valid voxel positions are (0,0,0) to (63, 127, 255). Attempts to access voxels outside this range will result is accessing the
	/// border value (see getBorderValue() and setBorderValue()). PolyVox also has support for near infinite volumes which will be discussed later.
	/// 
	/// Access to individual voxels is provided via the setVoxelAt() and getVoxelAt() member functions. Advanced users may also be interested in
	/// the Sampler class for faster read-only access to a large number of voxels.
	/// 
	/// Lastly the example prints out some properties of the LargeVolume. Note that the dimentsions getWidth(), getHeight(), and getDepth() are inclusive, such
	/// that the width is 64 when the range of valid x coordinates goes from 0 to 63.
	/// 
	/// Data Representaion
	/// ------------------
	/// If stored carelessly, volume data can take up a huge amount of memory. For example, a volume of dimensions 1024x1024x1024 with
	/// 1 byte per voxel will require 1GB of memory if stored in an uncompressed form. Natuarally our LargeVolume class is much more efficient
	/// than this and it is worth understanding (at least at a high level) the approach which is used.
	///
	/// Essentially, the LargeVolume class stores its data as a collection of blocks. Each of these block is much smaller than the whole volume,
	/// for example a typical size might be 32x32x32 voxels (though is is configurable by the user). In this case, a 256x512x1024 volume
	/// would contain 8x16x32 = 4096 blocks. The data for each block is stored in a compressed form, which uses only a small amout of
	/// memory but it is hard to modify the data. Therefore, before any given voxel can be modified, its corresponding block must be uncompressed.
	///
	/// The compression and decompression of block is a relatively slow process and so we aim to do this as rarely as possible. In order
	/// to achive this, the volume class stores a cache of recently used blocks and their associated uncompressed data. Each time a voxel
	/// is touched a timestamp is updated on the corresponding block. When the cache becomes full the block with the oldest timestamp is
	/// recompressed and moved out of the cache.
	///
	/// Achieving high compression rates
	/// --------------------------------
	/// The compression rates which can be achieved can vary significantly depending the nature of the data you are storing, but you can
	/// encourage high compression rates by making your data as homogenous as possible. If you are simply storing a material with each
	/// voxel then this will probably happen naturally. Games such as Minecraft which use this approach will typically involve large areas
	/// of the same material which will compress down well.
	///
	/// However, if you are storing density values then you may want to take some care. The advantage of storing smoothly changing values
	/// is that you can get smooth surfaces extracted, but storing smoothly changing values inside or outside objects (rather than just
	/// on the boundary) does not benefit the surface and is very hard to compress effectively. You may wish to apply some thresholding to 
	/// your density values to reduce this problem (this threasholding should only be applied to voxels who don't contribute to the surface).
	///
	/// Paging large volumes
	/// --------------------
	/// The compression scheme described previously will typically allow you to load several billion voxels into a few hundred megabytes of memory, 
	/// though as explained the exact compression rate is highly dependant on your data. If you have more data than this then PolyVox provides a
	/// mechanism by which parts of the volume can be paged out of memory by calling user supplied callback functions. This mechanism allows a
	/// potentially unlimited amount of data to be loaded, provided the user is able to take responsibility for storing any data which PolyVox
	/// cannot fit in memory, and then returning it back to PolyVox on demand. For example, the user might choose to temporarily store this data
	/// on disk or stream it to a remote database.
	///
	/// You can construct such a LargeVolume as follows:
	///
	/// \code
	/// void myDataRequiredHandler(const ConstVolumeProxy<MaterialDensityPair44>& volume, const PolyVox::Region& reg)
	/// {
	///		//This function is being called because part of the data is missing from memory and needs to be supplied. The parameter
	///		//'volume' provides access to the volume data, and the parameter 'reg' indicates which region of the volume you need fill.	
	/// }
	///
	/// void myDataOverflowHandler(const ConstVolumeProxy<MaterialDensityPair44>& vol, const PolyVox::Region& reg)
	/// {
	///		//This function is being called because part of the data is about to be removed from memory. The parameter 'volume' 
	///		//provides access to the volume data, and the parameter 'reg' indicates which region of the volume you need to store.
	/// }
	///
	///	LargeVolume<Density>volData(&myDataRequiredHandler, &myDataOverflowHandler);
	/// \endcode
	///
	/// Essentially you are providing an extension to the LargeVolume class - a way for data to be stored once PolyVox has run out of memory for it. Note
	/// that you don't actually have to do anything with the data - you could simply decide that once it gets removed from memory it doesn't matter
	/// anymore. But you still need to be ready to then provide something to PolyVox (even if it's just default data) in the event that it is requested.
	///
	/// Cache-aware traversal
	/// ---------------------
	/// You might be suprised at just how many cache misses can occur when you traverse the volume in a naive manner. Consider a 1024x1024x1024 volume
	/// with blocks of size 32x32x32. And imagine you iterate over this volume with a simple three-level for loop which iterates over x, the y, then z.
	/// If you start at position (0,0,0) then ny the time you reach position (1023,0,0) you have touched 1024 voxels along one edge of the volume and
	/// have pulled 32 blocks into the cache. By the time you reach (1023,1023,0) you have hit 1024x1024 voxels and pulled 32x32 blocks into the cache.
	/// You are now ready to touch voxel (0,0,1) which is right nect to where you started, but unless your cache is at least 32x32 blocks large then this
	/// initial block has already been cleared from the cache.
	///
	/// Ensuring you have a large enough cache size can obviously help the above situation, but you might also consider iterating over the voxels in a
	/// different order. For example, if you replace your three-level loop with a six-level loop then you can first process all the voxels between (0,0,0)
	/// and (31,31,31), then process all the voxels between (32,0,0) and (63,0,0), and so forth. Using this approach you will have no cache misses even
	/// is your cache sise is only one. Of course the logic is more complex, but writing code in such a cache-aware manner may be beneficial in some situations.
	///
	/// Threading
	/// ---------
	/// The LargeVolume class does not make any guarentees about thread safety. You should ensure that all accesses are performed from the same thread.
	/// This is true even if you are only reading data from the volume, as concurrently reading from different threads can invalidate the contents
	/// of the block cache (amoung other problems).
