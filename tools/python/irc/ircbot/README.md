ircbot
======

A simple SSL compatible IRC bot in pure python

This project requires a few non-default libraries:
* RottenTomatoes - https://github.com/zachwill/rottentomatoes
* BeautifulSoup - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

Neither of these are required for basic IRC functionality, but enable additional functions.
