Luna Game Engine

src19 is linux only for now there were alot or changes made before and after the old repository was committed. sortof a fresh start focusing mainly on linux.

ffmpeg is LGPL from the libs repo.

engine is zlib other than sockets code being ported out for irc client and p5 glove controller/ awaiting email on that.

have special permission to use cwiid code as zlib for engine and derivitaves.
