Luna Game Engine

ffmpeg and P5 glove driver are LGPL from the libs repo.
engine is zlib other than sockets code being ported out for irc client and p5 glove controller/ awaiting email on that.
have special permission to use cwiid code as zlib for engine and derivitaves but OIS looks like a better option.


engine itself is zlib licence.
