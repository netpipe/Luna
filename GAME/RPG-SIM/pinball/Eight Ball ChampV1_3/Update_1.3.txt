EIGHT BALL CHAMP (BALLY, 1985)
for Future Pinball v1.9
******************************
UPDATE V1.3
******************************

NEW IN UPDATE V1.3:
-------------------

- Added: "ArcadeMode" constant in script, I hope it will be useful for players using cabinet (arcade mode). Please read explanations in Const section from script.
         NOTE: all HUD overlays are on LAYER #5.
- Added: default settings for recommended 5-balls, ready to use!
- Added: coin door open/close: use [D] anytime you want to open or close the coin door. When open, you can see the game keyboard!
- Added: implemented Test Mode, for registers access.
         When the coin door is open (you see the game keyboard), press [Test] or [T] key to enter Test Mode.
         NOTE: [Test] button can be assigned from Future Pinball's "Preferences"/"Game Keys and Control" menu.
         Use keypad: [0] to [9] for value entry, keypad [Enter] to validate and keypad [.] to emulate real KEYBD/CLR.
         NOTE: red keys on keyboard (A to F and *) mean they'are unused. Pressed key will flashes during short time (yellow).
         GAME will flash yellow when [Test] button (or [T] key) is pressed to exit Test Mode.
         Implemented total of 40 registers: 35 are realistic, plus 5 "fictious" (as add-on for Future Pinball conversion):
           - 22 game feature options (game settings).
           - 17 bookkeeping (statistics).
           - 1 "reset to recommended defaults" for 3-balls or 5-balls.
         USING TEST MODE REQUIRES KEYBOARD WITH NUMERIC KEYPAD (however, "NumLock" can be ON or OFF).
- Added: emulated realist starting sequence: when "Play Table", or when exit from Test Mode.
- Added: missing TILT, with realistic sound effects. Tilt can be adjusted from (fictious) register #21.
- Added: implemented slam tilt switch: only when the coin door is open, use [S] to activate slam tilt switch: the game will reset immediatly. Useful to abord a running game quickly!
- Added: HUD state is now saved, restored as required on next startups. HUD now uses [ToggleHUD] key (instead of [Special2] key).
- Fixed: HUD display bug when score is over 10,000,000 points (missing left digit).
- Added: Ball in play in scoring HUD, using balls (1 to 5) as "icons".
- Fixed: bug concerning all balls lights (near targets), all turned on after 8-ball made. Now correct group (solid or stripe) is lit, and opposite group stays... unlit.
- Fixed: redesigned call ball routine - Sub FindCallBall(), also added 150 ms delayed FindCallBall for leaf target hits (this delay is required for drop target raise).
- Fixed: E-I-G-H-T lamps now unlit on every "8-ball" made.
- Added: High score initials entries removed: only Hi Score To Date - HSD - (or over 10,000,000) are tracked in FP high score table at 1st position.
- Fixed: Now the table state is correctly restored on EXTRA BALL when playing BALL IN PLAY #1.
- Fixed: some timers related variables has been replaced by timer's internal .UserData, some variables has been renamed too.
- Fixed: unused declared variables (or initialized but never used) are removed.
- Fixed: right sligshot moved a bit down (now aligned with left slingshot). By the way, 'P' green inlane light is now visible :-)
- Fixed: completed C-H-A-M-P sequences, now works correctly exactly as indicated on official rules cards and manual.
- Fixed: speech during attract mode disabled or played every specified amount of minutes - from 1 to 5 (register #47).
- Fixed: spinner starting value on every ball: start at 100 points or 1,000 points (register #49).
- Fixed: 120k and 240k lamps (now they always unlit at game start, like real game).
- Fixed: SPECIAL for 120k/240k handling (registers #44/#45).
- Fixed: left and right roll-up (10k/20k/30k/40k) scoring and sequences, based on official manual and real videos.
- Fixed: Sub CheckRollover() has been redesigned, no more unwanted scorings/advances occur on next rounds, using added Sub RestoreRollovers()
- Fixed: right roll-up trigger moved a bit because sometimes (often) the ball doesn't hit this trigger.
- Fixed: added missing SPECIAL handling for left and right roll-up (10k/20k/30k/40k/50k) (register #51).
- Fixed: outhole countdown bonus scoring was bad. Now fixed at 15k per rack ball, 10k per EIGHT letter and 50k per BALL letter.
- Fixed: only the right flipper button can rotate C-H-A-M-P lanes lights (clockwise), like real pinball game (also indicated on apron).
         Unlit C-H-A-M-P are correctly saved during bonus countdown if they rotate (by right flipper button) during bonus countdown (reworked RestorePlayerState subroutine).
- Fixed: EXTRA BALL and SPECIAL for completed EIGHT sequences. EXTRA BALL can be flashing at start of game or when B of BALL is made (register #43).
- Added: scoring thresholds and related awards (registers #12/#13/#14, register #24 for award type, registers #32/#33/#34 for bookkeeping).
         Thresholds can be entered in any orded (not sorted), the program will sort them, and cancels one if two are same.
- Added: High score to date / 10,000,000 award.
- Added: free play: if set to free play mode, the CREDIT display is always turned off, credit light on apron always on, and "nvCredits" variable remains unaffected.
- Reworked all indicators on backglass (based on some videos), used more realistic font (Arial Black).
- Added: missing SHOOT AGAIN and MATCH indicators.
- Fixed: GAME OVER indicator doesn't blink (based on some videos).
- Fixed: scores at zero now displayed like "00" (based on some videos and photos). Fixed also for the HUD reels.
- Added: related player's score display now blinks on new ball (blink will stop when scoring, based on some videos), same for HUD reels.
- Fixed: CREDIT display now displays two digits anytime, even if credit stock is less than 10 (based on some videos and photos).
- Added: MATCH feature with realistic sound effects. MATCH feature can be enabled/disabled (register #29).
- Added: new sounds: flippers (previous was too "woody" style), plunger and power switch (played only when "Play Table").
- Fixed: flippers can be activated between rounds (more realistic).
- Added: Now apron cards reflect the game setting! Both left and right model can be customized: standard (black & white) or color (red & blue), via... registers #18/#19!
- Fixed: Two invisible guides are added to close gap between lower bumper and pegs (to avoid ball stucks here).
- Fixed: Knocker routine (entirely redesigned).
- Many parts of the script are redesigned or optimized.

NOT FIXED YET (TO DO?):
-------------------

- Ball stuck points, in particular near top kicker, top gates and spinner.
- Jumping ball when the ball quits the plunger lane, on bumpers.
- Left roll up lane guide(s) and trigger may be redesigned (cosmetic).
- Apron texture: the hole above the plunger trigger looks very bad (aliasing effect).
