		float Density;

		//! The Reverb Diffusion property controls the echo density in the reverberation decay. It's set by
		//! default to 1.0, which provides the highest density. Reducing diffusion gives the reverberation a

		//! diffusion value of 0.0, the later reverberation sounds like a succession of distinct echoes.
		//! Range: 0.0 to 1.0
		float Diffusion;

		//! The Reverb Gain property is the master volume control for the reflected sound (both early
		//! reflections and reverberation) that the reverb effect adds to all sound sources. It sets the
		//! maximum amount of reflections and reverberation added to the final sound mix. The value of the
		//! Reverb Gain property ranges from 1.0 (0db) (the maximum amount) to 0.0 (-100db) (no reflected
		//! sound at all).
		//! Range: 0.0 to 1.0
		float Gain;

		//! The Reverb Gain HF property further tweaks reflected sound by attenuating it at high frequencies.
		//! It controls a low-pass filter that applies globally to the reflected sound of all sound sources
		//! feeding the particular instance of the reverb effect. The value of the Reverb Gain HF property
		//! ranges from 1.0 (0db) (no filter) to 0.0 (-100db) (virtually no reflected sound). HF Reference sets
		//! the frequency at which the value of this property is measured.
		//! Range: 0.0 to 1.0

		//! The Reverb Gain LF property further tweaks reflected sound by attenuating it at low frequencies.
		//! It controls a high-pass filter that applies globally to the reflected sound of all sound sources

		//! the frequency at which the value of this property is measured.
		//! Range: 0.0 to 1.0
		float GainLF;

		//! The Decay Time property sets the reverberation decay time. It ranges from 0.1 (typically a small
		//! room with very dead surfaces) to 20.0 (typically a large room with very live surfaces).
		//! Range: 0.1 to 20.0
		float DecayTime;

		//! The Decay HF Ratio property adjusts the spectral quality of the Decay Time parameter. It is the
		//! ratio of high-frequency decay time relative to the time set by Decay Time. The Decay HF Ratio
		//! value 1.0 is neutral: the decay time is equal for all frequencies. As Decay HF Ratio increases
		//! above 1.0, the high-frequency decay time increases so it's longer than the decay time at mid
		//! frequencies. You hear a more brilliant reverberation with a longer decay at high frequencies. As
		//! the Decay HF Ratio value decreases below 1.0, the high-frequency decay time decreases so it's
		//! shorter than the decay time of the mid frequencies. You hear a more natural reverberation.
		//! Range: 0.1 to 20.0
		float DecayHFRatio;

		//! The Decay LF Ratio property adjusts the spectral quality of the Decay Time parameter. It is the
		//! ratio of low-frequency decay time relative to the time set by Decay Time. The Decay LF Ratio
		//! value 1.0 is neutral: the decay time is equal for all frequencies. As Decay LF Ratio increases
		//! above 1.0, the low-frequency decay time increases so it's longer than the decay time at mid
		//! frequencies. You hear a more booming reverberation with a longer decay at low frequencies. As
		//! the Decay LF Ratio value decreases below 1.0, the low-frequency decay time decreases so it's
		//! shorter than the decay time of the mid frequencies. You hear a more tinny reverberation.
		//! Range: 0.1 to 20.0
		float DecayLFRatio;

		//! The Reflections Gain property controls the overall amount of initial reflections relative to the Gain
		//! property. (The Gain property sets the overall amount of reflected sound: both initial reflections
		//! and later reverberation.) The value of Reflections Gain ranges from a maximum of 3.16 (+10 dB)
		//! to a minimum of 0.0 (-100 dB) (no initial reflections at all), and is corrected by the value of the
		//! Gain property. The Reflections Gain property does not affect the subsequent reverberation decay.
		//! Range: 0.0 to 3.16
		float ReflectionsGain;

		//! The Reflections Delay property is the amount of delay between the arrival time of the direct path
		//! from the source to the first reflection from the source. It ranges from 0 to 300 milliseconds. You
		//! can reduce or increase Reflections Delay to simulate closer or more distant reflective surfaces—
		//! and therefore control the perceived size of the room.
		//! Range: 0.0 to 0.3
		float ReflectionsDelay;

		//! The Reflections Pan property is a 3D vector that controls the spatial distribution of the cluster of
		//! early reflections. The direction of this vector controls the global direction of the reflections, while
		//! its magnitude controls how focused the reflections are towards this direction.
		//! It is important to note that the direction of the vector is interpreted in the coordinate system of the
		//! user, without taking into account the orientation of the virtual listener. For instance, assuming a
		//! four-point loudspeaker playback system, setting Reflections Pan to (0, 0, 0.7) means that the
		//! reflections are panned to the front speaker pair, whereas as setting of (0, 0, -0.7) pans the
		//! reflections towards the rear speakers. These vectors follow the a left-handed co-ordinate system,
		//! unlike OpenAL uses a right-handed co-ordinate system.
		//! If the magnitude of Reflections Pan is zero (the default setting), the early reflections come evenly
		//! from all directions. As the magnitude increases, the reflections become more focused in the
		//! direction pointed to by the vector. A magnitude of 1.0 would represent the extreme case, where
		//! all reflections come from a single direction.
		cVector3 ReflectionsPan;

		//! The Late Reverb Gain property controls the overall amount of later reverberation relative to the
		//! Gain property. (The Gain property sets the overall amount of both initial reflections and later
		//! reverberation.) The value of Late Reverb Gain ranges from a maximum of 10.0 (+20 dB) to a
		//! minimum of 0.0 (-100 dB) (no late reverberation at all).
		//! Range: 0.0 to 10.0
		float LateReverbGain;

		//! The Late Reverb Delay property defines the begin time of the late reverberation relative to the
		//! time of the initial reflection (the first of the early reflections). It ranges from 0 to 100 milliseconds.
		//! Reducing or increasing Late Reverb Delay is useful for simulating a smaller or larger room.
		//! Range: 0.0 to 0.1
		float LateReverbDelay;

		//! The Late Reverb Pan property is a 3D vector that controls the spatial distribution of the late
		//! reverb. The direction of this vector controls the global direction of the reverb, while its magnitude
		//! controls how focused the reverb are towards this direction. The details under Reflections Pan,
		//! above, also apply to Late Reverb Pan.
		cVector3 LateReverbPan;

		//! Echo Time controls the rate at which the cyclic echo repeats itself along the
		//! reverberation decay. For example, the default setting for Echo Time is 250 ms. causing the echo
		//! to occur 4 times per second. Therefore, if you were to clap your hands in this type of
		//! environment, you will hear four repetitions of clap per second.
		//! Range: 0.075 to 0.25
		float EchoTime;

		//! Echo Depth introduces a cyclic echo in the reverberation decay, which will be noticeable with
		//! transient or percussive sounds. A larger value of Echo Depth will make this effect more
		//! prominent. 
		//! Together with Reverb Diffusion, Echo Depth will control how long the echo effect will persist along
		//! the reverberation decay. In a more diffuse environment, echoes will wash out more quickly after
		//! the direct sound. In an environment that is less diffuse, you will be able to hear a larger number
		//! of repetitions of the echo, which will wash out later in the reverberation decay. If Diffusion is set
		//! to 0.0 and Echo Depth is set to 1.0, the echo will persist distinctly until the end of the
		//! reverberation decay.
		//! Range: 0.0 to 1.0
		float EchoDepth;
		
		//! Using these two properties below, you can create a pitch modulation in the reverberant sound. This will
		//! be most noticeable applied to sources that have tonal color or pitch. You can use this to make
		//! some trippy effects! Modulation Time controls the speed of the vibrato (rate of periodic changes in pitch).
		//! Range: 0.004 to 4.0
		float ModulationTime;

		//! Modulation Depth controls the amount of pitch change. Low values of Diffusion will contribute to
		//! reinforcing the perceived effect by reducing the mixing of overlapping reflections in the
		//! reverberation decay.
		//! Range: 0.0 to 1.0
		float ModulationDepth;

		//! The Air Absorption Gain HF property controls the distance-dependent attenuation at high
		//! frequencies caused by the propagation medium. It applies to reflected sound only. You can use
		//! Air Absorption Gain HF to simulate sound transmission through foggy air, dry air, smoky
		//! atmosphere, and so on. The default value is 0.994 (-0.05 dB) per meter, which roughly
		//! corresponds to typical condition of atmospheric humidity, temperature, and so on. Lowering the
		//! value simulates a more absorbent medium (more humidity in the air, for example); raising the
		//! value simulates a less absorbent medium (dry desert air, for example).
		//! Range: 0.892 to 1.0
		float AirAbsorptionGainHF;

		//! The properties HF Reference and LF Reference determine respectively the frequencies at which
		//! the high-frequency effects and the low-frequency effects created by EAX Reverb properties are
		//! measured, for example Decay HF Ratio and Decay LF Ratio.
		//! Note that it is necessary to maintain a factor of at least 10 between these two reference
		//! frequencies so that low frequency and high frequency properties can be accurately controlled and
		//! will produce independent effects. In other words, the LF Reference value should be less than
		//! 1/10 of the HF Reference value.
		//! Range: 1000.0 to 20000.0
		float HFReference;

		//! See HFReference.
		//! Range: 20.0 to 1000.0
		float LFReference;

		//! The Room Rolloff Factor property is one of two methods available to attenuate the reflected
		//! sound (containing both reflections and reverberation) according to source-listener distance. It's
		//! defined the same way as OpenAL's Rolloff Factor, but operates on reverb sound instead of
		//! direct-path sound. Setting the Room Rolloff Factor value to 1.0 specifies that the reflected sound
		//! will decay by 6 dB every time the distance doubles. Any value other than 1.0 is equivalent to a
		//! scaling factor applied to the quantity specified by ((Source listener distance) - (Reference
		//! Distance)). Reference Distance is an OpenAL source parameter that specifies the inner border
		//! for distance rolloff effects: if the source comes closer to the listener than the reference distance,
		//! the direct-path sound isn't increased as the source comes closer to the listener, and neither is the
		//! reflected sound.
		//! The default value of Room Rolloff Factor is 0.0 because, by default, the Effects Extension reverb
		//! effect naturally manages the reflected sound level automatically for each sound source to
		//! simulate the natural rolloff of reflected sound vs. distance in typical rooms.
		//! Range: 0.0 to 10.0
		float RoomRolloffFactor;

		//! When this flag is set, the high-frequency decay time automatically stays below a limit value that's
		//! derived from the setting of the property Air Absorption Gain HF. This limit applies regardless of
		//! the setting of the property Decay HF Ratio, and the limit doesn't affect the value of Decay HF
		//! Ratio. This limit, when on, maintains a natural sounding reverberation decay by allowing you to
		//! increase the value of Decay Time without the risk of getting an unnaturally long decay time at
		//! high frequencies. If this flag is set to false, high-frequency decay time isn't automatically
		//! limited.
