 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the Main API Documentation for cAudio 2.3.0.  cAudio is an advanced C++ wrapper around OpenAL, a professional and powerful
 * audio library.  Thus cAudio provides you with a number of classes to allow you to easily manipulate your audio world and
 * intergrate audio effects like reverberation, doppler, attenuation, ect.  cAudio also has a plugin system, allowing developers to extend 
 * the functionality of the library.  Furthermore, cAudio is released under the zlib license, meaning it is free for you to use in your projects, 
 * even if they are commercial.  Of course, we suggest you read the full text of the license by looking at the local license.txt file or cAudio.h.
 *
 * Included with the SDK is a number of tutorials.  We suggest you begin with them as they will guide you through the basics of cAudio usage
 * and work up to more advanced topics.
 * \section links Links

 * Below is a simple "Hello World" example of how to use the engine.  Of course this is only the "tip of the iceburg"

 *
 * int main()
 * {

 *	cAudio::IAudioManager* manager = cAudio::createAudioManager(true);
 *
 *	//Create an audio source and load a sound from a file
 *	cAudio::IAudioSource* mysound = manager->create("music","../../media/cAudioTheme1.ogg",true);
 *
 *	if(mysound)
 *	{
 *		//Play our source in 2D once.
 *		mysound->play2d(false);
 *
 * 		//Wait for the sound to finish playing
 * 		while(mysound->isPlaying())
 *			cAudio::cAudioSleep(10);
 *	}
 *
 *	//Shutdown cAudio
 *	manager->shutDown();
 *	cAudio::destroyAudioManager(manager);
